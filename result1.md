### 2. Beef in Beer

## I ngredients

500g of cheap beef pieces (stewing steak usually is cheap)

500 mls of real ale

4 large onions

2 fat cloves of garlic

tbsp of plain flour

## Method

Raw beef, roll it in the flour...fry 4-5 pieces at a time in a hot saucepan to seal...put to one side when all done

cut the onions into quarters...fry in the same frying pan as the beef...to soak up the juices...

Towards the end of frying the onion (they should be nicely brown round the edges) throw in the smashed up cloves of garlic.

Transfer the beef, onions, garlic to a deep casserole dish. Stir in the remaining flour

pour on the bottle of beer - really, it isn't going to be wasted!!!

Cover, and cook at 150 for about 2 and a half hours...will be gorgeous when it comes out, trust me...serve with mash

### 7. Omelette

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgs/img_in_image_box_145_217_524_560.jpg" alt="Image" width="31%" /></div>


Ingredients

3 Eggs

Salt and Pepper

Butter

Grated cheese (optional)

Mixed herbs (optional)

## Method

1) Mix the eggs in any sort of bowl or jug you like (a pint glass works well!) with salt, pepper and herbs if desired.

2) Heat the butter (or oil) in a reasonably large frying pan.

3) Pour in the egg mixture slowly and swirl the pan a little to even it out.

4) After 30 seconds or so the top should firm up, at this point add grated cheese if you like.

5) Continue cooking a little until the cheese begins to melt, then fold the omelette in half with a bendy spatula

6) If its nice and cooked on the bottom already then serve, otherwise, continue cooking on each side a little more!

Sometimes I make an omelette with loads of onions, chopped sausages and vegetables in. If you do this then you probably wont be able to fold it so instead, pop the pan under a grill to finish the top off after its cooked underneath!

### 8. Egg fried rice

## I ngredients

Rice (as much as you fancy really!)

Half an onion (Or more, again if you fancy it)

A tin of sweetcorn

A few mushrooms

1-2 eggs

## Method

Start cooking the rice however you do, and put some oil in a frying pan.

Chop the onion into bits, any size really, doesnt matter particularly and throw into the frying pan.

Chop the mushrooms and add to the onions.

Once the rice is cooked, drain it off and add it into the frying pan.

Tip the drained sweetcorn into the pan as well and stir it all up.

Break the eggs into the pan (OR beat them together in another bowl and tip into the frying pan) and stir the mixture up.

At this point, you need to keep stirring the mixture, keeping the eggs moving. Keep going until the eggs have cooked, should take about 5-8 minutes maybe?
